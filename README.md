# FCS-Notes
The SILK Life initiative is deeply embedded in our GEN ECOvillage, which spans across the Mid-Ohio Valley, encompassing regions such as Pomeroy, Racine, and Marietta in Ohio, as well as Grantsville, Ravenswood, and Parkersburg in West Virginia. This ECOvillage is a testament to our commitment to sustainable living, community engagement, and holistic well-being.

At Leslie's property, we have established organic gardens that serve as a cornerstone for our sustainable agriculture training programs. These gardens are meticulously maintained using eco-friendly practices, providing a hands-on learning environment for members to understand the intricacies of organic farming, soil health, and sustainable crop rotation.

Vivian's flower garden is another integral part of our ECOvillage, offering a serene space for members to learn about horticulture, floral design, and the therapeutic benefits of gardening. This garden is not only a place of beauty but also a hub for educational workshops on plant care, biodiversity, and environmental stewardship.

Terri's horse ranch provides a unique opportunity for members to engage with equine-assisted activities, which are known to enhance emotional well-being and foster a deep connection with nature. The ranch also serves as a training ground for equine care, riding, and the principles of animal husbandry, all of which are essential components of our Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS) curriculum.

SILK Corp's leased buildings throughout the Mid-Ohio Valley are designed to integrate seamlessly with the natural environment. These facilities include yoga studios, workspace rooms, and high-tech bedrooms, often surrounded by lush gardens. These spaces are utilized for a variety of wellness programs, including yoga, meditation, and mindfulness training, all aimed at promoting physical and mental health.

Danielle's homestead is a prime example of self-sufficiency and sustainable living. As a doula, Danielle provides invaluable support to expectant mothers, while her greenhouse serves as a learning center for sustainable gardening practices. Homeschooling her two children, Danielle embodies the principles of holistic education, and her husband's work as a lumberjack highlights the importance of sustainable forestry practices.

By joining SILK Life in the Mid-Ohio Valley, members are immersed in a comprehensive FCS training program that covers all facets of sustainable living. This includes organic farming, horticulture, animal husbandry, wellness practices, and holistic education. Our ECOvillage is a vibrant community where members can learn, grow, and contribute to a sustainable future, all while being supported by the strength, integrity, love, and kindness that define SILK Corp.
